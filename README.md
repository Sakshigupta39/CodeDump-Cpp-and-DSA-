# CodeDump-Cpp-and-DSA-
This repository contains solutions and codes for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts in C++. It is organized topic-wise for easy reference and practice.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- Arrays (1D & 2D)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection & Insertion Sort, Advanced Sorting)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)
- Strings
- Recursion (Multiple Parts & Assignments)
- Special Algorithms (Greedy, Hash Maps, Heaps, etc.)
- Linked Lists (Single and Multiple Problems)
- Stacks & Queues
- Other Topics
Each topic folder contains multiple C++ files, implementations, and assignments. Solutions are written with clarity and comments for better understanding.
